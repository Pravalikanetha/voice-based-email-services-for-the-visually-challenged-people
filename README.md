# voice-based-email-services-for-the-visually-challenged-people
1.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
  The goal of voice-based email for the visually impaired people is to develop an
  application that will benefit the visually impaired to take advantage of every utility a regular
  person uses to send and receive emails effectively.
  The system will prompt the user with voice commands, users must use some keywords
  that will perform some actions. Example: Read, Send, Compose, etc. The voice mail system
  can be used by someone who is blind to easily access the emails.
  This application is based on the use of speech to text and text to speech translators,
  allowing everyone to control their email accounts through voice. The system will ask the user
  with voice commands to do certain actions and the user will reply to the same.
  Speech to Text, also called Automatic Speech Recognition, converts speech into text,
  allowing you to compose emails as an easy task.
  The Text to Speech module provides audio of the incoming mail, the sender, the subject,
  and the body of the outgoing mail. The information will be read out by the system. This makes
  it possible to condense the dependence of people with visual impairments on email-related
  activities.
  
  
1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
  A voice email system is a fully computerized system that allows users to share and
  communicate messages without typing. It is primarily beneficial to the blind because all official
  information and documents are only transmitted via email.
  The primary benefit of this system is that the need of the keyboard is totally eliminated,
  and the user will only react through voice. This approach aims to assist partially sighted people
  in promoting the development of digital India through the use of the internet, as well as to make
  their lives simpler.
